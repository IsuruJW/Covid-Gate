A COVID safety gate system for public entrance
Develped by Isuru Jayashankha 2021/10/11

Includes code, simulation and PCB layout and other details for the smart covid safety system.
Idea is to introduce a safety system for public places to limit the number of people at any public entrance.

This project includes:
 - An Arduino microcontroller
 - Two LDR's at the entrance
 - A Gate (Two servo motors are used here)
 - Two push buttons
 - A keypad
 - 3 LCD displays connected through I2C communication
 - A sanitiser
 - Temperature sensor
 - An ultrasonic sensor
 - A speaker
 - Indicator lights
 - A speaker
 - A mobile app
 - And some more components.
 
The functionality is explained in flowcharts and case diagrams.
The corrospoding numbers related to different voice messages are shown in the pdf files.

 Note that the simulation doesent include all the necessary components. 
 
 The PCB was designed using KICAD and it includes a rectifier circuit and better power regulation throughout the components.
 
 Thanks.
